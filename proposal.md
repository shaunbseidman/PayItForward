Project Description

This application offers the user the ability to search local organizations in need of donated items. 

Problem Statement

Many of us have items to donate, but sometimes it is difficult to allocate where they should and rather than give an organization something they do not need, this app aims to solve that problem by allowing them to specifially post what items they are in need of. 

Solution

By having the organazation upload specific items to the Realm database, it allows the user to look for specific items that they have it at home.

User Experience

The user will open up the Swift app, greeted with a list of local organizations, the user can then click on a specific organization and from there be directed to their items needed page. The user will then be able to click and add a check mark next to the specified item(s) they wish to donate. The item will then be updated in the database, allowing the admin (the organization themselves) to then delete the item. 

Technology

Front end will be built in Swift and import select CocoaPod kits for functionality. 
The backend database will be built in Realm and implement CoreData and plist
